Type cast as throws ClassCastException, if the cast is unsuccessful. 
Safe cast as? returns null, if the cast is unsuccessful. 
Declare the s variable to make the first line print null (i.e. println(s as? Int) and the second one throw an exception (println(s as Int?)).

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val s = 2.0
    println(s as? Int)    // null
    println(s as Int?)    // exception
}

Note: if val s is any variable other than Int. If will give the result.
like val s = "String" or s = 2.0
